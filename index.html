          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I'm Kaiden Jones, an independent researcher, author, and philosopher dedicated to exploring the intersections of science, philosophy, and human experience[cite: 7]. My work focuses on understanding the boundaries of observation and perception within conceptual and practical systems[cite: 8]. Since 2018, I have independently developed the Half-Silvering Dimensions framework, a theoretical model that investigates directional observation and unidirectional definability[cite: 10, 26].</p>
          <p>In addition to formal research, I am a published author of speculative and science fiction, including my novella <em>2938: Atlantis</em>[cite: 13]. Through these creative works, I aim to make complex scientific and philosophical ideas accessible to broader audiences[cite: 14]. My lived experience as a care-experienced young person in the UK also informs a pragmatic and socially conscious approach to my research, which I have applied to real-world policy and social reform initiatives through youth advocacy and community projects[cite: 15].</p>
